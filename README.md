# Sparkify Capstone Project

## Project Overview
Predicting customer churn using for a fictional company ‘Sparkify’ using pyspark . The intial analysis was done using a smaller subset of the main 12 GB data file.

## Steps

*Load and Clean Dataset  
*Define Churn  
*Exploratory Data Analysis  
*Feature Engineering  
*Baseline   
*Model Selection  
*Modelling  
*Evaluation   
*Improvements  

## File Structure

The repository contains following files.  
1. data – small 123MB data subset of 12GB full data file . Had to leave out because of GitHub limits  
2. sparkify.ipynb – project analysis  
3. readme.md - Readme file  

## Installation 

Following packages should be installed in the system before running the notebook.  
Pyhon3  
pyspark.sql  
pyspark.ml  
datetime  
matplotlib  
seaborn  
numpy  
pandas   
warnings  

see Jupyter Notebook sparkify.ipyn for full details
